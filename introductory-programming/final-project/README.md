A program that reads a CSV file of US Crime data. This data was supplied by the University. It provides the user the option to receive statistical analysis on the following:

- Percentages in population growth for each consecutive year from 1994 to 2013
- In which year the murder rate was the highest or lowest
- In which year the robbery rate was the highest or lowest
- In which year motor vehicle theft was the highest or lowest

It also keeps track of how long the application was running.
