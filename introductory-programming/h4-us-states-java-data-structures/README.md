# homework-4

A program that asks a user to enter a state and then will tell them the state bird and state flower. When the user is done, the program will print a 'summary' (it's not a summary, but the assignment called for exactly the printed data, and referred to it as a summary).

Data was not given from the university, so an annoying proces of scraping the web for this data was necessary. I learned a little about birds though...and which state flags are the coolest.
