## A collection of labs and projects from my courses at University of Maryland Global Campus

Each directory for the project is a ROT13 cipher text of the project name, in order to prevent current students from searching for solutions to homework assignments.

If you’re a current student, congrats, you found a solution. But you probably **shouldn’t** use it. You’re hurting yourself by not learning, and I bet there’s some kind of _TurnItIn_ parser the university uses to check if you’ve used a previous student's work. If you use my code, you deserve to get caught. Like…that’s shitty. For _**you**_ more than anyone else.
