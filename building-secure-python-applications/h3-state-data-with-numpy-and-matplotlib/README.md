# homework-3

Create a Python CLI program that:

- Displays all U.S. States in alphabetical order; including the capital, state population, and flower
- Searchs for a specific state, and displays its capital city, population, and an image of the flower
- Displays a bar graph of the top 5 most populated states with their overall population.
- Update the population number for a specific state (if the user is a diety)

This lab was to explore Python lists, sequences, dictionaries, and sets. Additionally, we were first exposed to and instructed to make use of popular Python libraries Numpy and Matplotlib.

The data and images were _not_ provided to us, so lots and lots of web scraping was done. If I have used an image without permission, I'm very sorry and will remove it upon request.
