Create a Python CLI program that loads one of two comma separated values (.CSV) and then performs a chosen stastical analysis on them. This time, data was supplied by the University. However, one of the CSV's had an anomoly or outlier in the dataset that created a very high standard deviation, resulting in some odd looking graphs.

The goal was to demonstrate knowledge of File i/o, Exceptions, and more object-oriented programming functionality in Python, as well as as extension of comprehension of Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib libraries. This time we do get to use Dataframes! ðŸ¤“
